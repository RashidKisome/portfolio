# [2020 NewsBlog](https://rashidkisome.github.io/2020-newsblog/)

I wanted to build something that lists all the "crazy events" that have happened during this year.
I also plan on rebuilding this blog in the near future to include more functionality and make the UI more appealing to look at.
REPO: https://github.com/RashidKisome/2020-newsblog/

# [Covid19-Api](https://rashidkisome.github.io/corona-app/)

I wanted to try an efficient & user-friendly way to display data with React.
This data is displayed using the ChartJS library which you can read about here https://www.chartjs.org/ if you want to utilize it yourself.

# [Kanban Board](https://github.com/RashidKisome/kanban-board)

Being a big fan of producticity tools, I wanted to combine learning Angular and build something I would actually use myself, this project is a replica of something like Trello.
In this project I discovered how powerful Angular CDK can be, here I used the "Drag-Drop" module which was very simple to implenent. https://material.angular.io/cdk/drag-drop/overview

# [Brilliant Works codetest](https://github.com/RashidKisome/Brilliant-Works-CodeTest)

This simple ionic/angular app was part of a codetest I did, it simply displays the subscription offers and their prices provided from the API.
The code is a a bit messy as it is filled filled with unnecessary comments which I deliberately kept in the code.
